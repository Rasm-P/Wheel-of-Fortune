    <string name="game_rules">The game is for one player. When the game starts, a word is randomly chosen from predefined categories and
        displayed along with the category. The word/phrase is displayed with the letters hidden and the individual words separated for a
        phrase. The possible results of the “spinning the wheel” are: a number of points e.g 1000 or an “extra turn”, “miss turn” or
        “bankrupt”. In the event of a value being shown, a letter (consonant or vowel) is chosen by the user. If the letter is present,
        the user’s points total is incremented by the value shown times the number of occurrences of the letter. The occurrences of the
        letter are revealed in the word. If the letter is not present the user loses a “life”.  In the event of “extra turn” being shown,
        the user is given an extra life. In the event of “miss turn” being shown, the user loses a life without being able to choose a
        letter. In the event of “bankrupt” being shown, the user loses all their points. The “wheel is spun” until the game is won or
        lost. The “wheel is spun” until the game is won or lost. The game is lost when the user has no lives left and the word has not
        been found. A user starts with 5 “lives”.
